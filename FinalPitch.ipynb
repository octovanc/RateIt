       "\"Hello students welcome to another. Lecture of this course foundation of education technology. Today. We are again going to discuss some of the important theories. Picture applicable to design. Enter block a type of educational content. Education technology solutions. Aur any kind of educational app. Discuss about the cognitive load theory of cognitive load theory is basically proposed by john. Who is a. Great. Cognitive researcher. According to trailer. There are three basic components. Ok. Working memory. Long term memory. And cognitive load. In my last lecture. I disc. About working memory or compressed people also call it as short term memory and also long term memory. Yeah we are hearing a new term it is called the cognitive load. No again i want to just. We call the thing to what memory is the system. With the limited chemist capacity where all the information is being processed. Whatever you are providing some kind of content some kind of phenol is post knowledge. Aur any kind of. Information. Which. The student is. Taking into account. So that is. Being processed in the working memory part of our. Brain. Long term memory. Is it. Define from the term. The information is it. For very long time or we can say it. Indefinitely. Whenever we are providing any kind of information. Our brain. Need to provide some. Airport. To process the information. So here. That effort. We can see in the cognitive science is called the cognitive load. Ok. Important term is cognitive lottery we can say it a dye folding used in the end. Working memory to process and formation is. Cognitive. Mention that. There are different types of. Cognitive load. Intrinsic cognitive load. Extraneous cognitive load. And. German cognitive. Intrinsic cognitive computing test people also call it as known as ltd. Non altered means. It cannot be changed. We cannot change that. Buy any how. There is a story about. Aur bhi cancer example of. Newton's second law of motion. Ok. We cannot change the concept of newton's second law of motion. We need to keep it as it is. But how make it. Teacher for the student. Death depends on. We can say. Intrinsic cognitive load is dose elements that must be processed simultaneously. Next about the extraneous cognitive load. These are also known as. Non desirable. You'll find that whenever some people are presenting some tough as a powerpoint. They will have had a lot of animation complete the coming year complete the coming there. Too many animation. Which is not necessary. Or we can say it is used elements are non desirable elements. If those element are being added to what is happening. The cognitive load will increase. Give the cognitive load is increasing that means we need to provide more effort. Pro to to process the information in the working memory. Sbi know that working memory has a limited capacity. Simply i am just giving one example at we compare our human brain with the computer system. If our computer system with 5 4gb ram. Ok and you are running too many. Software so what will happen it will hang. Aur it will stop working. Right. Because. It is not enough. Power law. Ram to process the information. Same thing here also. What if you are providing too much. Information. So our brain will not be able to process information ultimate si what will happen. Students should understand. You will fail to understand those colour. Avoid. Extraneous cognitive load. Next he mentioned about the german cognitive load. Aur it is also known as desirable. Desirable interesting. Suppose there is a machine. Ok. And i am teaching the function of machine or example for mechanical engine. Ok if i am teaching the process and functions of different components of engine on the board. It will be difficult for the students to understand. Define providing some kind of 3d simulation for the student and then i can visualise how piston is moving what kind of other components what are the rule of what are the functions of different components. Ok. It will be easier for the students to understand that concept. Using 3d cell simulation or animation autumn other way of representation of complex. Concept. Make it easier for the students. Those elements. Help the lander. Ok. You can confirm din for transfer the information. From short term memory into long term memory and. So. It is always. Suggestible. That. For the complex concert we must try to visualise some of the. Are using some of the technology or any other way. Ok. Make the concept easier for this. What is the role of the. German cognitive. If i classify these three types i can see the good the bad the ugly. Obviously. The german cognitive load. Will. Be the good. Ok the intrinsic cognitive that will be the bad because we don't have any option to l today. Monitor. Imposed by some kind of task you are providing some kind of. Material you are providing ok come teaching concept. The concept you are providing. Ok. Extraneous cognitive load i can see the earliest one because it depends on us. How we are presenting the information to the learners to the users. The students. German cognitive load it a good intrinsic cognitive load is a bad and the ugly. Provided some. Recommendation. Ok. So. First very important is that. We need to change the way of problem solving method. Talking. So that means. To avoid the heavy working memory load. It's better if you can provide some of the problem real life. Student can school late. Doors. Problem. With their own environment. And then that will make them. That make them or help them. Call dost. Problem easier. Ok. Next is that. We must avoid to yourself sometimes we provide. Several sources of information. By integrating those sources. Suppose there is a newton. Law of motion and. You are under your providing the animation also you are providing some kind of reading material so you are providing some kind of simulations also. Different sources of information you are providing to the learners simultaneously. Ceo of this list will be difficult for the learner to process all those information family. Next. Obviously it is also unnecessary processing a repetition information by the duty sing the redundancy. Ok don't repeat the same information every time. Very important is that. We can also increase the working memory capacity. By using two channels. Hibiscus in my last class about the park. According study. Where i mentioned that it is always better to provide the information which can be passed from two channels. Sensory channel. Ice. End year. Ok because it the information is processed from one channel. Overloaded haba. Information is passed from 12 channels it is distributed. It will be easier for the student to. Understand. This is about. The joint john trailer. Cognitive load theory. Now this is very important theory and very much applicable in educational technology the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. Which is proposed by richard mia. Basically. Cognitive theory. Multimedia learning is based on. 12 coding theory. Which is proposed by public. And. Cognitive load theory was proposed by. You know that it is always like to mention that human process separate channels for. Persisting visual and auditory information. Jewel. Share mein maja added another thing that is the active processing. Ok. Vector processing what he is making to human in games. In active learning by attending to incoming if it is in the organised manner. Coherent manner. Especially with the mental representation with other knowledge like we had discussed about the. Multiple external reputation ok. Whenever we are providing this kind of information it is therefore the student to understand toachq answer. Again. This is the framework. For the cognitive theory of multimedia learning here you can find out. That 12 channel is applied here. Words and pictures. If you are providing any kind of information which contains words and pictures so what will be. Channel to yes pictures. Will be channeled through eyes. Then different types of sound and images ok it is processed here is the working memory. Where all the information is being processed here. Ok that is repeating the multimedia presentation that we are using this reduce our senses. So i send here. Selecting words and pictures of our working memory select the sounds and images which need to be kept for a shorter period or for a long period. Teri qabar model is a pictorial model and tenth integrate kiya. This. This will be the. Active process is going on. Ok send. Let me your has propose the third the third part is about the active processing where. It is mentioned that it should be in the organised manner. Where integrate. Both. Types of information. When we are taking the information to the bourbon board and the pic to remote it is integrated kiya. And. It is stored for the long term memory. It is called prior knowledge what is brand alert. Suppose i am teaching. I am taking some kind of concept of supports integration. Abhaipur integration you must have the knowledge about limit. Limit theory. Ok you don't know what is limit. So it will be difficult for you to solve the problems of integration. You have learnt limit. Stored. In your long term memory so when i am teaching you the integration i am using some kind of symbols or some kind of you know animation not come other stuff. That is being processed and then it can correlate when i am talking about limits so. The brain will take the knowledge from the. Long term memory which is for the brand knowledge. How to make a correlation ok to have already the brain will saying think that i have already learnt. Limit point need to use a limit. Ok the knowledge of my limit to go for the integration. Ok. Here is the total cost of the total framework of the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. What we can gain from here to always whenever we are designing any stocks or providing any kind of learning material. So we must try to provide the information which can be processed. Youtube channel ideas and ice. Ok multimedia presentation to contains like de. Maher provided. Some of the important principles of cognitive theory of multimedia learning. The different principles and we are going to discuss. Different principles and i am going to provide you some of the examples also at how these princes are being applied here. The first the redundancy principle. What is happening in the first. Picture you can find out. Jerry can say that. There is. In this case is that. There is the animation plus narration. Yeh intercaste at animation. Plus. Narration. Sorry. Where is the first case you can see here. There is the narration. And then there is a subtitle yeah that is the on screen text. Ok. But how. Dear. You can find out is only. Narration is there and animation is there. Now what is happening here. Which case is better. Sketchware animation + narration. In the second case where it is animation + narration + on screen text. Is very simple. So when we are just think when we are animation and plus narration the first case animation soviet is looking the animation. And from the narration the information is being processed and from animation from ise information using process. Right. In the second case what is happening. We need to see the animation also. And we need to see the on screen text also. Why were that will result what. Our eyes need to have. Process more information. And then there is a year. Which generation is going on. Shukla first k animation + narration. Is better. Dhanteras ke. Animation + narration + on print text. I am just giving you one example. There are many south indian movies like tamil telugu movies 2012 good movies so but. We don't know. Autumn of some of us like me we don't know that i am in your telugu language. It was dost movies by watching. Bus stop title. Do you enjoyed that. Movie. Equally. To a movie which like suppose you are moving are you are watching the movie in your own language i am from hindi language from hindi language of english language i like to watch movie. Where i no need to read. The on-screen text not subtitle. Obviously. Second ke. Because the first case when i am watching a movie with a different language. I need to see the what is going on in the video. I need to read the on screen text also. And sometimes narration is going on so i don't know whether it can be processed through email or not. It is always advisable that it should be animation plus narration so whenever you are there. You are providing some kind of simulation you are creating some kind of animation for the students. Try to avoid the onscreen text. Pure providing animation just have a background narration. This is the student to process information. Congress. Please one example i am providing you can find out so much of. So many things. Are integrated care. Figure 4 2000 graphic card. Ok there are different types of pictures are there. It's very difficult. To understand. So it is always advise. Avoid graphic word sound from the day. Brijbhan singh less is more. We can provide some information. Awesome concert by using les. Graphics words of sounds. Then that is the best. Don't use unnecessary. Think. Not relatable. Try to make it more simpler. As far as possible. About the queries. Multimedia principle multimedia. Ok here is the skull. Richard number. There is a skill. Which different parts. Where is the it is mentioned. Labelling is given. In which case it is easier. Second kiss. Because i can cool it ok this part is the frontal bone. Rishi kapoor hit boss whatsapp of this number i had given. And then later on i am saying ok this is the the number one. Is the frontal bone or whatever you cannot from biology. Later take one example. Ok so this like this one is the wall maar ok i can say that number 10 is world war. Very difficult for the student to. Recognise the different parts. Like this. Ok. Kabaddi we can provide here ok the student can correlate here. It will be easier. Pedestrian 2010 tak concert. Pictures plus words. Ok should be together. Next modality principle. Lord shiva mortality principal again this is very interesting so. Latest tech one example. Ok. In the first case you can see. Information. Like animation + narration. And animation and on screen. Again here the animation plus on screen text. That is. Single channel. But if there is animation. Animation. Last narration to channel starting you. So the information can be process easier. As compared to the first. Ok. It is always advisable for please provide animation with narration. As per as possible. Better than the onscreen text. Nexus the contributory principle. Locket equity principle here again you can see. They have provided. The labelling with different parts of share. What is the are doing today have. Number dear oral with alphabet and then here they are providing. The first win news fasi ok is front end of then he need to go for ok here is the frontal lobe. Ten hindi me to say ok what is eat then he took a game go down and then she ok this is the parietal lobe. But however in this case. What is happening the label for the parts of the brain are placed. Near the parts of the brain to which they are correspond. It is totally easy for restaurant the corresponding labels with the corresponding parts. In this chris case what is happening different parts. Interpreted from the image of the brain. Agale bling author. Levelling art separated from the different parts of the brain. Sudheer about the continuity paper. Very important is the signalling principle. People. Learn from the multimedia message when some kind of signals are. Aur. Suppose you are providing some information on the website or the user interface and in that. You think that some information are very very important. You need to highlight to provide the signal. For the student. You must be. Ready to understand this concept for this idea is very important you cannot avoid. Example whenever we have some website and then. Provide. Click here to download why. User interface design model why they are providing the signal to the user. Important part and you need to download. Until unless you your work will not happen. To make the user to make the system or the user interface easier. You should provide some important use of cygnus. Call dost. About the personalizing personalization principle. Kiya. Again it is not like you are just providing the animation or animation with narration that will be very. Good. Ok. It also important how. Are you providing the narration. Whether it's a conversation alve whether it's a formal way. It is always advisable. Whenever you are providing some kind of narration. It should be in the formal stand. I am gift giving example here so the narration is coming like that next i would like you to click on your name but in the other case. It's like click on the top name at the top of its like more former or mechanical in nature. Are humans and emo basically. They need interpersonal relationship. Aur. Feeling. Aur emotional. Ok. When you are providing this kind of conversation in wwe. Sofia rebel 2 mo. Correlate. Power cell with the system animation of simulation. It is always advisable whenever we are providing then a narration. It should be up should be in the conversation alve rather than the. Formal style. Very important thing is the pre training. Principal. I provide some citations also you can go to the citation and can get time formation of. Now. Features an example of body vr. About the author they have done. They have developed. Virtual reality. Aap august you man body or i think it's it's about the head of the cell. Wearing some kind of head mounted devices then you will feel like you have entered inside a cell and then. You can find out different parts of the same. What does pre training material is saying. So there thing that you know. You must be familiar. Vit a content item. Horse characteristics of the main concept. Before digging. I am providing you the journey of a cell. But. I have not provided you the information about different parts of animal cell. Then how you are going to recognise. When you will go to the journey inside the cell. You don't know mitochondria if you don't know cell membrane if you don't know who i was. If you don't know what is nucleus membrane. Cytoplasm. That will not. Show the purpose. Of the institute to take you. Having the experience. Apostille using virtual reality. I want research they have done. First have taught the students about different parts of animal cell. Ok. How it look like on baby. I'm not saying that looks like at least they should know different parts different names. When they will have the vr experience of a cell if there is pop up. Cytoplasm of mitochondria can you can learn about the mitochondria or membrane or ribosome. And then that to serve the purpose. So. It is that. More deeply from a multimedia when they know the names and characteristics of the main concept. Next is about the segmenting principle. What is segmenting principle i think you can recall i have taught you about the. Information processing theory by. George. What miller set. Myle mention 7 plus minus 2. Idea. Right. Like either 549. Chance of information. Our brain can process at one time. Dosti mein le li. Suppose. I am teaching you the all the theory. Together in a single class. It will be difficult for you guys. Digestive information. To process information. But now what i have done i have segmented ok today. First i will discuss. Any idea about information processing. I will talk about that well coding theory. Then i will talk about her sorry atkinson model 10 i will discuss about census i will discuss about working memory to you are getting familiar with this. And then i have come with the cognitive theory and cognitive theory of multimedia learning. So i have segmented the whole. Module into different parts. Also. I tried my best. To make you familiar with those concept with those terms like cognitive load perfume memory short term memory. Long term memory. Cognition. Census. Dual channel. So now when you are going to the from the first video. Of learning theory module. So can you start your journey from the information. Surya and then you can come here. Then you can understand all the information. Egypt. If i would have explain cognitive theory of multimedia learning the very beginning it would have difficult for you to understand. Because you are not familiar with the term. About working memory long term memory all those kind of stuff for cognitive load. You can talk about the cell division. What. Amir propose near propose. That. Student learn better when multimedia message is presented in a user. Page segment sainik continuous. Direct two things very important things here. We are not when we are saying about a classroom when we are talking about. A product. When we are developing a product. We are not. Developing or teaching. One specific. Person. It is not. For one user whenever we are developing anything. We are developing for multiple users. You have different needs. You have different backgrounds. You have different ability. Wait some mental ability. Whether it's a different types of ability military emotional ability. Intelligent. How we are going to cater all those needs. Nat divert. Population. Your product will. Successful. Only. Only when you are going to. Chapter. Different. Pupil. Mi. It's ok if it's only for a. One individual one user specific need. Definitely people. In the cake. In this case. Some of the students they are very. Hyper form. Achievers. Some students who are very low at cheapest. What they have done they have segmented the information. Similarly there can be play the animation. Take input taken for what if a high achiever you knows everything. Ok we can. If he knows the initial idea about the. Sindhi bitten chicken fast forward. Nobody is stopping the height cheaper he can go to the end. But if it suppose if i would have developed. An animation based taking care of that iit per student. It will be difficult for the lower tuberous root. To understand that concept. So. What they have done every type of. Average height. Lekar understand by using de. So if you have any doubt you can replay. Text that the one important. Purpose for. Me also to create the videos. Because i don't know. I haven't met you face to face i don't know. Myclass standard. Now i have uploaded the videos you can go to the videos. You can repeat you can see again and again. Indian. When we are going to have discussion you can ask your question. Indian weekend. Kiska. And i can resolve your issues and or your doubts or your questions. About critically about the segment. Electric meters. Make it more. User friendly pizza paste. It is not for. Only do it but it is not only for the highest. Product. 35. Aur kutta. Everyone me. Next is. People learn better when narration is poking in a human voice rather than a machine. It is very important. Nowadays. We are using nlp. Text. Speech. Is very easy. However there is a research. We had also done our research. 5 points about. Robot. Cartoon. Chinese alphabets. Small cake. So what we have done we have used the voice of a mother. In one robot. And in another we have to use angle to. And we. The robot of the students who. Where interacting with the robot with. Mother's voice. Women boy. Divya performing better as compared to the. Machine. Again. As we ask you meant we always want. The things which are. Which we can correlate. Not familiar with the machine boy. More familiar with the small kids so they are more familiar with. With your mother and. There was a third case also. So there was a voice of. Open man. Wintec is also student and not very much you know. Performing better. But the education robot. English we have used. Womens white. State perform better. As compared to the other. Sudheer also very important whenever we are doing. The narration. It should be done in a. Shivam boys. In a conversation null time. Kuchh kam. Here you can see. We have discussed so many. Principles of auditing theory of multimedia learning. I am not saying that. We need to apply each and every principle. Whenever we are developing any product. Any app. Any user interface. Parineeti kinnaur contact teaching and learning content material. What we can try our best. Aspirate. I am giving you two examples here. You can see. This is before applying the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. Also before. And this is. So how they had used. So you can find out. Review of multimedia principles of what is the multimedia place of can you relate. Bullet text here the bullet text they have replaced by picture. It will be easier. Next the korean special all the pictures and text directly not related to contract it. Ok. I mentioned this is more. Pick the things which are not relevant or irrelevant this remove. Discard. Special quality graphs and related text. Appeared continuously on the screen. Ok. It's not like content you know what is happening. You are providing the grass and then the text is coming. No. Text and graph should come from a tennessee. Signalling principle how they have used so they have highlighted the important point by. Large. Paul. Different colour of skin. Then. What they have done there is a temple of two graphs and related explain represented in the same slide. It's not in the another slide. And. Last is the model in principle show. Some of the day had used pictures of graph. Explain with the narration. Ok. So you can you can refer dipper also to understand. How to get more in details. I have just taken some of the pictures here you have also provided the citation for your thing. We can go through the paper and then find out. How they have applied. Staples. Last very important thing is. Mast. Understand one very important point. You are not designing for yourself. You are designing for other user. So you need to think. From the other users perspective. What will be good. Patna ticket. Hots going to help the user it is not going to help them. Today we have discussed. About cognitive load theory. Cognitive theory of multimedia learning. Different components of cognitive theory of multimedia learning. We discuss this different. Principles of cognitive theory of multimedia learning. Aur dost. Can be applied. About the given one example. And. Paristhiti 16 i want to show you some of the example. So this is about. Cognitive theory of multimedia learning and. The next. My lecture. I will talk about cognitive flexibility theory and. Authentic learning. What kind of interesting to call for low porosity clan. Thank you very much. \""

In active learning by attending to incoming if it is in the organised manner. Coherent manner. Especially with the mental representation with other knowledge like we had discussed about the. Multiple external reputation ok. Whenever we are providing this kind of information it is therefore the student to understand toachq answer. Again. This is the framework. For the cognitive theory of multimedia learning here you can find out. That 12 channel is applied here. Words and pictures. If you are providing any kind of information which contains words and pictures so what will be. Channel to yes pictures. Will be channeled through eyes. Then different types of sound and images ok it is processed here is the working memory. Where all the information is being processed here. Ok that is repeating the multimedia presentation that we are using this reduce our senses. So i send here. Selecting words and pictures of our working memory select the sounds and images which need to be kept for a shorter period or for a long period. Karbonn model is a pictorial model and tenth integrate kiya. This. This will be the. Active process is going on. Ok send. Let me your has propose the third the third part is about the active processing where. It is mentioned that it should be in the organised manner. Where integrate. Both. Types of information. When we are taking the information to the bourbon board and the pic to remote it is integrated kiya. And. It is stored for the long term memory. It is called prior knowledge what is brand alert. Suppose i am teaching. I am taking some kind of concept of supports integration. Abhaipur integration you must have the knowledge about limit. Limit theory. Ok you don't know what is limit. So it will be difficult for you to solve the problems of integration. You have learnt limit. Stored. In your long term memory so when i am teaching you the integration i am using some kind of symbols or some kind of you know animation not come other stuff. That is being processed and then it can correlate when i am talking about limits so. The brain will take the knowledge from the. Long term memory which is for the brand knowledge. How to make a correlation ok to have already the brain will saying think that i have already learnt. Limit point need to use a limit. Ok the knowledge of my limit to go for the integration. Ok. Here is the total cost of the total framework of the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. What we can gain from here to always whenever we are designing any stocks or providing any kind of learning material. So we must try to provide the information which can be processed. Youtube channel ideas and ice. Ok multimedia presentation to contains like de. Maher provided. Some of the important principles of cognitive theory of multimedia learning. The different principles and we are going to discuss. Different principles and i am going to provide you some of the examples also at how these princes are being applied here. The first the redundancy principle. What is happening in the first. Picture you can find out. Jerry can say that. There is. In this case is that. There is the animation plus narration. Yeh intercaste at animation. Plus. Narration. Sorry. Where is the first case you can see here. There is the narration. And then there is a subtitle yeah that is the on screen text. Ok. But how. Dear. You can find out is only. Narration is there and animation is there. Now what is happening here. Which case is better. Sketchware animation + narration. In the second case where it is animation + narration + on screen text. Is very simple. So when we are just think when we are animation and plus narration the first case animation soviet is looking the animation. And from the narration the information is being processed and from animation from ice the information is being processed. Right. In the second case what is happening. We need to see the animation also. And we need to see the on screen text also. Why were that will result what. Our eyes need to have. Process more information. And then there is a year. Which generation is going on. Shukla first k animation + narration. Is better. Dhanteras ke. Animation + narration + on print text. I am just giving you one example. There are many south indian movies like tamil telugu movies 2012 good movies so but. We don't know. Autumn of some of us like me we don't know that i am in your telugu language. It was dost movies by watching. Bus stop title. Do you enjoyed that. Movie. Equally. To a movie which like suppose you are moving are you are watching the movie in your own language i am from hindi language from hindi language of english language i like to watch movie. Where i no need to read. The on-screen text not subtitle. Obviously. Second ke. Because the first case when i am watching a movie with a different language. I need to see the what is going on in the video. I need to read the on screen text also. And sometimes narration is going on so i don't know whether it can be processed through email or not. It is always advisable that it should be animation plus narration so whenever you are there. You are providing some kind of simulation you are creating some kind of animation for the students. Try to avoid the onscreen text. Pure providing animation just have a background narration. This is the student to process information. Congress. Please one example i am providing you can find out so much of. So many things. Are integrated care. Figure 4 2000 graphic card. Ok there are different types of pictures are there. It's very difficult. To understand. So it is always advise. Avoid graphic word sound from the day. Brijbhan singh less is more. We can provide some information. Awesome concert by using les. Graphics words of sounds. Then that is the best. Don't use unnecessary. Think. Not relatable. Try to make it more simpler. As far as possible. About the queries. Multimedia principle multimedia. Ok here is the skull. Richard number. There is a skill. Which different parts. Where is the it is mentioned. Labelling is given. In which case it is easier. Second kiss. Because i can cool it ok this part is the frontal bone. Rishi kapoor hit boss whatsapp of this number i had given. And then later on i am saying ok this is the the number one. Is the frontal bone or whatever you cannot from biology. Later take one example. Ok so this like this one is the wall maar ok i can say that number 10 is world war. Very difficult for the student to. Recognise the different parts. Like this. Ok. Kabaddi we can provide here ok the student can correlate here. It will be easier. Pedestrian 2010 tak concert. Pictures plus words. Ok should be together. Next modality principle. Lord shiva mortality principal again this is very interesting so. Latest tech one example. Ok. In the first case you can see. Information. Like animation + narration. And animation and on screen. Again here the animation plus on screen text. That is. Single channel. But if there is animation. Animation. Last narration to channel starting you. So the information can be process easier. As compared to the first. Ok. It is always advisable for please provide animation with narration. As per as possible. Better than the onscreen text. Nexus the contributory principle. Locket equity principle here again you can see. They have provided. The labelling with different parts of share. What is the are doing today have. Number dear oral with alphabet and then here they are providing. The first win news fasi ok is front end of then he need to go for ok here is the frontal lobe. Ten hindi me to say ok what is eat then he took a game go down and then she ok this is the parietal lobe. But however in this case. What is happening the label for the parts of the brain are placed. Near the parts of the brain to which they are correspond. It is totally easy for the strength the corresponding labels with the corresponding parts. In this chris case what is happening different parts. Interpreted from the image of the brain. Agale bling author. Levelling art separated from the different parts of the brain. Sudheer about the continuity paper. Very important is the signalling principle. People. Learn from the multimedia message when some kind of signals are. Aur. Suppose you are providing some information on the website or the user interface and in that. You think that some information are very very important. You need to highlight to provide the signal. For the student. You must be. Ready to understand this concept for this idea is very important you cannot avoid. Example whenever we have some website and then. Provide. Click here to download why. User interface design model why they are providing the signal to the user. Important part and you need to download. Until unless you your work will not happen. To make the user to make the system or the user interface easier. You should provide some important use of cygnus. Call dost. About the personalizing personalization principle. Kiya. Again it is not like you are just providing the animation or animation with narration that will be very. Good. Ok. It also important how. Are you providing the narration. Whether it's a conversation alve whether it's a formal way. It is always advisable. Whenever you are providing some kind of narration. It should be in the formal stand. I am gift giving example here so the narration is coming like that next i would like you to click on your name but in the other case. It's like click on the top name at the top of its like more former or mechanical in nature. Are humans and emo basically. They need interpersonal relationship. Aur. Feeling. Aur emotional. Ok. When you are providing this kind of conversation in wwe. Sofia rebel 2 mo. Correlate. Power cell with the system animation of simulation. It is always advisable whenever we are providing then a narration. It should be up should be in the conversation alve rather than the. Formal style. Very important thing is the pre training. Principal. I provide some citations also you can go to the citation and can get time formation of. Now. Features an example of body vr. About the author they have done. They have developed. Virtual reality. Aap august you man body or i think it's it's about the head of the cell. Wearing some kind of head mounted devices then you will feel like you have entered inside a cell and then. You can find out different parts of the same. What does pre training material is saying. So there thing that you know. You must be familiar. Vit a content item. Horse characteristics of the main concept. Before digging. I am providing you the journey of a cell. But. I have not provided you the information about different parts of animal cell. Then how you are going to recognise. When you will go to the journey inside the cell. You don't know mitochondria if you don't know cell membrane if you don't know who i was. If you don't know what is nucleus membrane. Cytoplasm. That will not. Show the purpose. Of the institute to take you. Having the experience. Apostille using virtual reality. I want research they have done. First have taught the students about different parts of animal cell. Ok. How it look like on baby. I'm not saying that looks like at least they should know different parts different names. When they will have the vr experience of a cell if there is pop up. Cytoplasm of mitochondria can you can learn about the mitochondria or membrane or ribosome. And then that to serve the purpose. So. It is that. More deeply from a multimedia when they know the names and characteristics of the main concept. Next is about the segmenting principle. What is segmenting principle i think you can recall i have taught you about the. Information processing theory by. George. What miller set. Myle mention 7 plus minus 2. Idea. Right. Like either 549. Chance of information. Our brain can process at one time. Dosti mein le li. Suppose. I am teaching you the all the theory. Together in a single class. It will be difficult for you guys. Digestive information. To process information. But now what i have done i have segmented ok today. First i will discuss. Any idea about information processing. I will talk about that well coding theory. Then i will talk about her sorry atkinson model 10 i will discuss about census i will discuss about working memory to you are getting familiar with this. And then i have come with the cognitive theory and cognitive theory of multimedia learning. So i have segmented the whole. Module into different parts. Also. I tried my best. To make you familiar with those concept with those terms like cognitive load perfume memory short term memory. Long term memory. Cognition. Census. Dual channel. So now when you are going to the from the first video. Of learning theory module. So can you start your journey from the information. Surya and then you can come here. Then you can understand all the information. Egypt. If i would have explain cognitive theory of multimedia learning the very beginning it would have difficult for you to understand. Because you are not familiar with the term. About working memory long term memory all those kind of stuff for cognitive load. You can talk about the cell division. What. Amir propose near propose. That. Student learn better when multimedia message is presented in a user. Page segment sainik continuous. Direct two things very important things here. We are not when we are saying about a classroom when we are talking about. A product. When we are developing a product. We are not. Developing or teaching. One specific. Person. It is not. For one user whenever we are developing anything. We are developing for multiple users. You have different needs. You have different backgrounds. You have different ability. Wait some mental ability. Whether it's a different types of ability military emotional ability. Intelligent. How we are going to cater all those needs. Nat divert. Population. Your product will. Successful. Only. Only when you are going to. Chapter. Different. Pupil. Mi. It's ok if it's only for a. One individual one user specific need. Definitely people. In the cake. In this case. Some of the students they are very. Hyper form. Achievers. Some students who are very low at cheapest. What they have done they have segmented the information. Similarly there can be play the animation. Take input taken for what if a high achiever you knows everything. Ok we can. If he knows the initial idea about the. Sindhi bitten chicken fast forward. Nobody is stopping the height cheaper he can go to the end. But if it suppose if i would have developed. An animation based taking care of that iit per student. It will be difficult for the lower tuberous root. To understand that concept. So. What they have done every type of. Average height. Lekar understand by using de. So if you have any doubt you can replay. Text that the one important. Purpose for. Me also to create the videos. Because i don't know. I haven't met you face to face i don't know. Myclass standard. Now i have uploaded the videos you can go to the videos. You can repeat you can see again and again. Indian. When we are going to have discussion you can ask your question. Indian weekend. Kiska. And i can resolve your issues and or your doubts or your questions. About critically about the segment. Electric meters. Make it more. User friendly pizza paste. It is not for. Only do it but it is not only for the highest. Product. 35. Aur kutta. Everyone me. Next is. People learn better when narration is poking in a human voice rather than a machine. It is very important. Nowadays. We are using nlp. Text. Speech. Is very easy. However there is a research. We had also done our research. 5 points about. Robot. Cartoon. Chinese alphabets. Small cake. So what we have done we have used the voice of a mother. In one robot. And in another we have to use angle to. And we. The robot of the students who. Where interacting with the robot with. Mother's voice. Women boy. Divya performing better as compared to the. Machine. Again. As we ask you meant we always want. The things which are. Which we can correlate. Not familiar with the machine boy. More familiar with the small kids so they are more familiar with. With your mother and. There was a third case also. So there was a voice of. Open man. Wintec is also student and not very much you know. Performing better. But the education robot. English we have used. Womens white. State perform better. As compared to the other. Sudheer also very important whenever we are doing. The narration. It should be done in a. Shivam boys. In a conversation null time. Kuchh kam. Here you can see. We have discussed so many. Principles of auditing theory of multimedia learning. I am not saying that. We need to apply each and every principle. Whenever we are developing any product. Any app. Any user interface. Parineeti kinnaur contact teaching and learning content material. What we can try our best. Aspirate. I am giving you two examples here. You can see. This is before applying the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. Also before. And this is. So how they had used. So you can find out. Review of multimedia principles of what is the multimedia place of can you relate. Bullet text here the bullet text they have replaced by picture. It will be easier. Next the korean special all the pictures and text directly not related to contract it. Ok. I mentioned this is more. Pick the things which are not relevant or irrelevant this remove. Discard. Special quality graphs and related text. Appeared continuously on the screen. Ok. It's not like content you know what is happening. You are providing the grass and then the text is coming. No. Text and graph should come from a tennessee. Signalling principle how they have used so they have highlighted the important point by. Large. Paul. Different colour of skin. Then. What they have done there is a temple of two graphs and related explain represented in the same slide. It's not in the another slide. And. Last is the model in principle show. Some of the day had used pictures of graph. Explain with the narration. Ok. So you can you can refer dipper also to understand. How to get more in details. I have just taken some of the pictures here you have also provided the citation for your thing. We can go through the paper and then find out. How they have applied. Staples. Last very important thing is. Mast. Understand one very important point. You are not designing for yourself. You are designing for other user. So you need to think. From the other users perspective. What will be good. Patna ticket. Hots going to help the user it is not going to help them. Today we have discussed. About cognitive load theory. Cognitive theory of multimedia learning. Different components of cognitive theory of multimedia learning. We discuss this different. Principles of cognitive theory of multimedia learning. Aur dost. Can be applied. About the given one example. And. Paristhiti 16 i want to show you some of the example. So this is about. Cognitive theory of multimedia learning and. The next. My lecture. I will talk about cognitive flexibility theory and. Authentic learning. What kind of interesting to call for low porosity clan. Thank you very much. \""

       "'Hello students welcome to another  Lecture of this course foundation of education technology  Today  We are again going to discuss some of the important theories  Picture applicable to design  Enter block a type of educational content  Education technology solutions  Aur any kind of educational app  Discuss about the cognitive load theory of cognitive load theory is basically proposed by john  Who is a  Great  Cognitive researcher  According to trailer  There are three basic components  Ok  Working memory  Long term memory  And cognitive load  In my last lecture  I disc  About working memory or compressed people also call it as short term memory and also long term memory  Yeah we are hearing a new term it is called the cognitive load  No again i want to just  We call the thing to what memory is the system  With the limited chemist capacity where all the information is being processed  Whatever you are providing some kind of content some kind of phenol is post knowledge  Aur any kind of  Information  Which  The student is  Taking into account  So that is  Being processed in the working memory part of our  Brain  Long term memory  Is it  Define from the term  The information is it  For very long time or we can say it  Indefinitely  Whenever we are providing any kind of information  Our brain  Need to provide some  Airport  To process the information  So here  That effort  We can see in the cognitive science is called the cognitive load  Ok  Important term is cognitive lottery we can say it a dye folding used in the end  Working memory to process and formation is  Cognitive  Mention that  There are different types of  Cognitive load  Intrinsic cognitive load  Extraneous cognitive load  And  German cognitive  Intrinsic cognitive computing test people also call it as known as ltd  Non altered means  It cannot be changed  We cannot change that  Buy any how  There is a story about  Aur bhi cancer example of  Newton s second law of motion  Ok  We cannot change the concept of newton s second law of motion  We need to keep it as it is  But how make it  Teacher for the student  Death depends on  We can say  Intrinsic cognitive load is dose elements that must be processed simultaneously  Next about the extraneous cognitive load  These are also known as  Non desirable  You ll find that whenever some people are presenting some tough as a powerpoint  They will have had a lot of animation complete the coming year complete the coming there  Too many animation  Which is not necessary  Or we can say it is used elements are non desirable elements  If those element are being added to what is happening  The cognitive load will increase  Give the cognitive load is increasing that means we need to provide more effort  Pro to to process the information in the working memory  Sbi know that working memory has a limited capacity  Simply i am just giving one example at we compare our human brain with the computer system  If our computer system with 5 4gb ram  Ok and you are running too many  Software so what will happen it will hang  Aur it will stop working  Right  Because  It is not enough  Power law  Ram to process the information  Same thing here also  What if you are providing too much  Information  So our brain will not be able to process information ultimate si what will happen  Students should understand  You will fail to understand those colour  Avoid  Extraneous cognitive load  Next he mentioned about the german cognitive load  Aur it is also known as desirable  Desirable interesting  Suppose there is a machine  Ok  And i am teaching the function of machine or example for mechanical engine  Ok if i am teaching the process and functions of different components of engine on the board  It will be difficult for the students to understand  Define providing some kind of 3d simulation for the student and then i can visualise how piston is moving what kind of other components what are the rule of what are the functions of different components  Ok  It will be easier for the students to understand that concept  Using 3d cell simulation or animation autumn other way of representation of complex  Concept  Make it easier for the students  Those elements  Help the lander  Ok  You can confirm din for transfer the information  From short term memory into long term memory and  So  It is always  Suggestible  That  For the complex concert we must try to visualise some of the  Are using some of the technology or any other way  Ok  Make the concept easier for this  What is the role of the  German cognitive  If i classify these three types i can see the good the bad the ugly  Obviously  The german cognitive load  Will  Be the good  Ok the intrinsic cognitive that will be the bad because we don t have any option to l today  Monitor  Imposed by some kind of task you are providing some kind of  Material you are providing ok come teaching concept  The concept you are providing  Ok  Extraneous cognitive load i can see the earliest one because it depends on us  How we are presenting the information to the learners to the users  The students  German cognitive load it a good intrinsic cognitive load is a bad and the ugly  Provided some  Recommendation  Ok  So  First very important is that  We need to change the way of problem solving method  Talking  So that means  To avoid the heavy working memory load  It s better if you can provide some of the problem real life  Student can school late  Doors  Problem  With their own environment  And then that will make them  That make them or help them  Call dost  Problem easier  Ok  Next is that  We must avoid to yourself sometimes we provide  Several sources of information  By integrating those sources  Suppose there is a newton  Law of motion and  You are under your providing the animation also you are providing some kind of reading material so you are providing some kind of simulations also  Different sources of information you are providing to the learners simultaneously  Ceo of this list will be difficult for the learner to process all those information family  Next  Obviously it is also unnecessary processing a repetition information by the duty sing the redundancy  Ok don t repeat the same information every time  Very important is that  We can also increase the working memory capacity  By using two channels  Hibiscus in my last class about the park  According study  Where i mentioned that it is always better to provide the information which can be passed from two channels  Sensory channel  Ice  End year  Ok because it the information is processed from one channel  Overloaded haba  Information is passed from 12 channels it is distributed  It will be easier for the student to  Understand  This is about  The joint john trailer  Cognitive load theory  Now this is very important theory and very much applicable in educational technology the cognitive theory of multimedia learning  Which is proposed by richard mia  Basically  Cognitive theory  Multimedia learning is based on  12 coding theory  Which is proposed by public  And  Cognitive load theory was proposed by  You know that it is always like to mention that human process separate channels for  Persisting visual and auditory information  Jewel  Share mein maja added another thing that is the active processing  Ok  Vector processing what he is making to human in games  In active learning by attending to incoming if it is in the organised manner  Coherent manner  Especially with the mental representation with other knowledge like we had discussed about the  Multiple external reputation ok  Whenever we are providing this kind of information it is therefore the student to understand toachq answer  Again  This is the framework  For the cognitive theory of multimedia learning here you can find out  That 12 channel is applied here  Words and pictures  If you are providing any kind of information which contains words and pictures so what will be  Channel to yes pictures  Will be channeled through eyes  Then different types of sound and images ok it is processed here is the working memory  Where all the information is being processed here  Ok that is repeating the multimedia presentation that we are using this reduce our senses  So i send here  Selecting words and pictures of our working memory select the sounds and images which need to be kept for a shorter period or for a long period  Teri qabar model is a pictorial model and tenth integrate kiya  This  This will be the  Active process is going on  Ok send  Let me your has propose the third the third part is about the active processing where  It is mentioned that it should be in the organised manner  Where integrate  Both  Types of information  When we are taking the information to

make a correlation ok to have already the brain will saying think that i have already learnt  Limit point need to use a limit  Ok the knowledge of my limit to go for the integration  Ok  Here is the total cost of the total framework of the cognitive theory of multimedia learning  What we can gain from here to always whenever we are designing any stocks or providing any kind of learning material  So we must try to provide the information which can be processed  Youtube channel ideas and ice  Ok multimedia presentation to contains like de  Maher provided  Some of the important principles of cognitive theory of multimedia learning  The different principles and we are going to discuss  Different principles and i am going to provide you some of the examples also at how these princes are being applied here  The first the redundancy principle  What is happening in the first  Picture you can find out  Jerry can say that  There is  In this case is that  There is the animation plus

this kind of conversation in wwe  Sofia rebel 2 mo  Correlate  Power cell with the system animation of simulation  It is always advisable whenever we are providing then a narration  It should be up should be in the conversation alve rather than the  Formal style  Very important thing is the pre training  Principal  I provide some citations also you can go to the citation and can get time formation of  Now  Features an example of body vr  About the author they have done  They have developed  Virtual reality  Aap august you man body or i think it s it s about the head of the cell  Wearing some kind of head mounted devices then you will feel like you have entered inside a cell and then  You can find out different parts of the same  What does pre training material is saying  So there thing that you know  You must be familiar  Vit a content item  Horse characteristics of the main concept  Before digging  I am providing you the journey of a cell  But  I have not provided you the information about different parts of animal cell  Then how you are going to recognise  When you will go to the journey inside the cell  You don t know mitochondria if you don t know cell membrane if you don t know who i was  If you don t know what is nucleus membrane  Cytoplasm  That will not  Show the purpose  Of the institute to take you  Having the experience  Apostille using virtual reality  I want research they have done  First have taught the students about different parts of animal cell  Ok  How it look like on baby  I m not saying that looks like at least they should know different parts different names  When they will have the vr experience of a cell if there is pop up  Cytoplasm of mitochondria can you can learn about the mitochondria or membrane or ribosome  And then that to serve the purpose  So  It is that  More deeply from a multimedia when they know the names and characteristics of the main concept  Next is about the segmenting principle  What is segmenting principle i think you can recall i have taught you about the  Information processing theory by  George  What miller set  Myle mention 7 plus minus 2  Idea  Right  Like either 549  Chance of information  Our brain can process at one time  Dosti mein le li  Suppose  I am teaching you the all the theory  Together in a single class  It will be difficult for you guys  Digestive information  To process information  But now what i have done i have segmented ok today  First i will discuss  Any idea about information processing  I will talk about that well coding theory  Then i will talk about her sorry atkinson model 10 i will discuss about census i will discuss about working memory to you are getting familiar with this  And then i have come with the cognitive theory and cognitive theory of multimedia learning  So i have segmented the whole  Module into different parts  Also  I tried my best  To make you familiar with those concept with those terms like cognitive load perfume memory short term memory  Long term memory  Cognition  Census  Dual channel  So now when you are going to the from the first video  Of learning theory module  So can you start your journey from the information  Surya and then you can come here  Then you can understand all the information  Egypt  If i would have explain cognitive theory of multimedia learning the very beginning it would have difficult for you to understand  Because you are not familiar with the term  About working memory long term memory all those kind of stuff for cognitive load  You can talk about the cell division  What  Amir propose near propose  That  Student learn better when multimedia message is presented in a user  Page segment sainik continuous  Direct two things very important things here  We are not when we are saying about a classroom when we are talking about  A product  When we are developing a product  We are not  Developing or teaching  One specific  Person  It is not  For one user whenever we are developing anything  We are developing for multiple users  You have different needs  You have different backgrounds  You have different ability  Wait some mental ability  Whether it s a different types of ability military emotional ability  Intelligent  How we are going to cater all those needs  Nat divert  Population  Your product will  Successful  Only  Only when you are going to  Chapter  Different  Pupil  Mi  It s ok if it s only for a  One individual one user specific need  Definitely people  In the cake  In this case  Some of the students they are very  Hyper form  Achievers  Some students who are very low at cheapest  What they have done they have segmented the information  Similarly there can be play the animation  Take input taken for what if a high achiever you knows everything  Ok we can  If he knows the initial idea about the  Sindhi bitten chicken fast forward  Nobody is stopping the height cheaper he can go to the end  But if it suppose if i would have developed  An animation based taking care of that iit per student  It will be difficult for the lower tuberous root  To understand that concept  So  What they have done every type of  Average height  Lekar understand by using de  So if you have any doubt you can replay  Text that the one important  Purpose for  Me also to create the videos  Because i don t know  I haven t met you face to face i don t know  Myclass standard  Now i have uploaded the videos you can go to the videos  You can repeat you can see again and again  Indian  When we are going to have discussion you can ask your question  Indian weekend  Kiska  And i can resolve your issues and or your doubts or your questions  About critically about the segment  Electric meters  Make it more  User friendly pizza paste  It is not for  Only do it but it is not only for the highest  Product  35  Aur kutta  Everyone me  Next is  People learn better when narration is poking in a human voice rather than a machine  It is very important  Nowadays  We are using nlp  Text  Speech  Is very easy  However there is a research  We had also done our research  5 points about  Robot  Cartoon  Chinese alphabets  Small cake  So what we have done we have used the voice of a mother  In one robot  And in another we have to use angle to  And we  The robot of the students who  Where interacting with the robot with  Mother s voice  Women boy  Divya performing better as compared to the  Machine  Again  As we ask you meant we always want  The things which are  Which we can correlate  Not familiar with the machine boy  More familiar with the small kids so they are more familiar with  With your mother and  There was a third case also  So there was a voice of  Open man  Wintec is also student and not very much you know  Performing better  But the education robot  English we have used  Womens white  State perform better  As compared to the other  Sudheer also very important whenever we are doing  The narration  It should be done in a  Shivam boys  In a conversation null time  Kuchh kam  Here you can see  We have discussed so many  Principles of auditing theory of multimedia learning  I am not saying that  We need to apply each and every principle  Whenever we are developing any product  Any app  Any user interface  Parineeti kinnaur contact teaching and learning content material  What we can try our best  Aspirate  I am giving you two examples here  You can see  This is before applying the cognitive theory of multimedia learning  Also before  And this is  So how they had used  So you can find out  Review of multimedia principles of what is the multimedia place of can you relate  Bullet text here the bullet text they have replaced by picture  It will be easier  Next the korean special all the pictures and text directly not related to contract it  Ok  I mentioned this is more  Pick the things which are not relevant or irrelevant this remove  Discard  Special quality graphs and related text  Appeared continuously on the screen  Ok  It s not like content you know what is happening  You are providing the grass and then the text is coming  No  Text and graph should come from a tennessee  Signalling principle how they have used so they have highlighted the important point by  Large  Paul  Different colour of skin  Then  What they have done there is a temple of two graphs and related explain represented in the same slide  It s not in the another slide  And  Last is the model in principle show  Some of the day had used pictures of graph  Explain with the narration  Ok  So you can you can refer dipper also to understand  How to get more in details  I have just taken some of the pictures here you have also provided the citation for your thing  We can go through the paper and then find out  How they have applied  Staples  Last very important thing is  Mast  Understand one very important point  You are not designing for yourself  You are designing for other user  So you need to think  From the other users perspective  What will be good  Patna ticket  Hots going to help the user it is not going to help them  Today we have discussed  About cognitive load theory  Cognitive theory of multimedia learning  Different components of cognitive theory of multimedia learning  We discuss this different  Principles of cognitive theory of multimedia learning  Aur dost  Can be applied  About the given one example  And  Paristhiti 16 i want to show you some of the example  So this is about  Cognitive theory of multimedia learning and  The next  My lecture  I will talk about cognitive flexibility theory and  Authentic learning  What kind of interesting to call for low porosity clan  Thank you very much  '"

      "Hello students welcome to another  Lecture of this course foundation of education technology  Today  We are again going to discuss some of the important theories  Picture applicable to design  Enter block a type of educational content  Education technology solutions  Aur any kind of educational app  Discuss about the cognitive load theory of cognitive load theory is basically proposed by john  Who is a  Great  Cognitive researcher  According to trailer  There are three basic components  Ok  Working memory  Long term memory  And cognitive load  In my last lecture  I disc  About working memory or compressed people also call it as short term memory and also long term memory  Yeah we are hearing a new term it is called the cognitive load  No again i want to just  We call the thing to what memory is the system  With the limited chemist capacity where all the information is being processed  Whatever you are providing some kind of content some kind of phenol is post knowledge  Aur any kind of  Information  Which  The student is  Taking into account  So that is  Being processed in the working memory part of our  Brain  Long term memory  Is it  Define from the term  The information is it  For very long time or we can say it  Indefinitely  Whenever we are providing any kind of information  Our brain  Need to provide some  Airport  To process the information  So here  That effort  We can see in the cognitive science is called the cognitive load  Ok  Important term is cognitive lottery we can say it a dye folding used in the end  Working memory to process and formation is  Cognitive  Mention that  There are different types of  Cognitive load  Intrinsic cognitive load  Extraneous cognitive load  And  German cognitive  Intrinsic cognitive computing test people also call it as known as ltd  Non altered means  It cannot be changed  We cannot change that  Buy any how  There is a story about  Aur bhi cancer example of  Newton s second law of motion  Ok  We cannot change the concept of newton s second law of motion  We need to keep it as it is  But how make it  Teacher for the student  Death depends on  We can say  Intrinsic cognitive load is dose elements that must be processed simultaneously  Next about the extraneous cognitive load  These are also known as  Non desirable  You ll find that whenever some people are presenting some tough as a powerpoint  They will have had a lot of animation complete the coming year complete the coming there  Too many animation  Which is not necessary  Or we can say it is used elements are non desirable elements  If those element are being added to what is happening  The cognitive load will increase  Give the cognitive load is increasing that means we need to provide more effort  Pro to to process the information in the working memory  Sbi know that working memory has a limited capacity  Simply i am just giving one example at we compare our human brain with the computer system  If our computer system with 5 4gb ram  Ok and you are running too many  Software so what will happen it will hang  Aur it will stop working  Right  Because  It is not enough  Power law  Ram to process the information  Same thing here also  What if you are providing too much  Information  So our brain will not be able to process information ultimate si what will happen  Students should understand  You will fail to understand those colour  Avoid  Extraneous cognitive load  Next he mentioned about the german cognitive load  Aur it is also known as desirable  Desirable interesting  Suppose there is a machine  Ok  And i am teaching the function of machine or example for mechanical engine  Ok if i am teaching the process and functions of different components of engine on the board  It will be difficult for the students to understand  Define providing some kind of 3d simulation for the student and then i can visualise how piston is moving what kind of other components what are the rule of what are the functions of different components  Ok  It will be easier for the students to understand that concept  Using 3d cell simulation or animation autumn other way of representation of complex  Concept  Make it easier for the students  Those elements  Help the lander  Ok  You can confirm din for transfer the information  From short term memory into long term memory and  So  It is always  Suggestible  That  For the complex concert we must try to visualise some of the  Are using some of the technology or any other way  Ok  Make the concept easier for this  What is the role of the  German cognitive  If i classify these three types i can see the good the bad the ****  Obviously  The german cognitive load  Will  Be the good  Ok the intrinsic cognitive that will be the bad because we don t have any option to l today  Monitor  Imposed by some kind of task you are providing some kind of  Material you are providing ok come teaching concept  The concept you are providing  Ok  Extraneous cognitive load i can see the earliest one because it depends on us  How we are presenting the information to the learners to the users  The students  German cognitive load it a good intrinsic cognitive load is a bad and the ****  Provided some  Recommendation  Ok  So  First very important is that  We need to change the way of problem solving method  Talking  So that means  To avoid the heavy working memory load  It s better if you can provide some of the problem real life  Student can school late  Doors  Problem  With their own environment  And then that will make them  That make them or help them  Call dost  Problem easier  Ok  Next is that  We must avoid to yourself sometimes we provide  Several sources of information  By integrating those sources  Suppose there is a newton  Law of motion and  You are under your providing the animation also you are providing some kind of reading material so you are providing some kind of simulations also  Different sources of information you are providing to the learners simultaneously  Ceo of this list will be difficult for the learner to process all those information family  Next  Obviously it is also unnecessary processing a repetition information by the duty sing the redundancy  Ok don t repeat the same information every time  Very important is that  We can also increase the working memory capacity  By using two channels  Hibiscus in my last class about the park  According study  Where i mentioned that it is always better to provide the information which can be passed from two channels  Sensory channel  Ice  End year  Ok because it the information is processed from one channel  Overloaded haba  Information is passed from 12 channels it is distributed  It will be easier for the student to  Understand  This is about  The joint john trailer  Cognitive load theory  Now this is very important theory and very much applicable in educational technology the cognitive theory of multimedia learning  Which is proposed by richard mia  Basically  Cognitive theory  Multimedia learning is based on  12 coding theory  Which is proposed by public  And  Cognitive load theory was proposed by  You know that it is always like to mention that human process separate channels for  Persisting visual and auditory information  Jewel  Share mein maja added another thing that is the active processing  Ok  Vector processing what he is making to human in games  In active learning by attending to incoming if it is in the organised manner  Coherent manner  Especially with the mental representation with other knowledge like we had discussed about the  Multiple external reputation ok  Whenever we are providing this kind of information it is therefore the student to understand toachq answer  Again  This is the framework  For the cognitive theory of multimedia learning here you can find out  That 12 channel is applied here  Words and pictures  If you are providing any kind of information which contains words and pictures so what will be  Channel to yes pictures  Will be channeled through eyes  Then different types of sound and images ok it is processed here is the working memory  Where all the information is being processed here  Ok that is repeating the multimedia presentation that we are using this reduce our senses  So i send here  Selecting words and pictures of our working memory select the sounds and images which need to be kept for a shorter period or for a long period  Teri qabar model is a pictorial model and tenth integrate kiya  This  This will be the  Active process is going on  Ok send  Let me your has propose the third the third part is about the active processing where  It is mentioned that it should be in the organised manner  Where integrate  Both  Types of information  When we are taking the information to the bourbon board and the pic to remote it is integrated kiya  And  It is stored for the long term memory  It is called prior knowledge what is brand alert  Suppose i am teaching  I am taking some kind of concept of supports integration  Abhaipur integration you must have the knowledge about limit  Limit theory  Ok you don t know what is limit  So it will be difficult for you to solve the problems of integration  You have learnt limit  Stored  In your long term memory so when i am teaching you the integration i am using some kind of symbols or some kind of you know animation not come other stuff  That is being processed and then it can correlate when i am talking about limits so  The brain will take the knowledge from the  Long term memory which is for the brand knowledge  How to make a correlation ok to have already the brain will saying think that i have already learnt  Limit point need to use a limit  Ok the knowledge of my limit to go for the integration  Ok  Here is the total cost of the total framework of the cognitive theory of multimedia learning  What we can gain from here to always whenever we are designing any stocks or providing any kind of learning material  So we must try to provide the information which can be processed  Youtube channel ideas and ice  Ok multimedia presentation to contains like de  Maher provided  Some of the important principles of cognitive theory of multimedia learning  The different principles and we are going to discuss  Different principles and i am going to provide you some of the examples also at how these princes are being applied here  The first the redundancy principle  What is happening in the first  Picture you can find out  Jerry can say that  There is  In this case is that  There is the animation plus narration  Yeh intercaste at animation  Plus  Narration  Sorry  Where is the first case you can see here  There is the narration  And then there is a subtitle yeah that is the on screen text  Ok  But how  Dear  You can find out is only  Narration is there and animation is there  Now what is happening here  Which case is better  Sketchware animation + narration  In the second case where it is animation + narration + on screen text  Is very simple  So when we are just think when we are animation and plus narration the first case animation soviet is looking the animation  And from the narration the information is being processed and from animation from ise information using process  Right  In the second case what is happening  We need to see the animation also  And we need to see the on screen text also  Why were that will result what  Our eyes need to have  Process more information  And then there is a year  Which generation is going on  Shukla first k animation + narration  Is better  Dhanteras ke  Animation + narration + on print text  I am just giving you one example  There are many south indian movies like tamil telugu movies 2012 good movies so but  We don t know  Autumn of some of us like me we don t know that i am in your telugu language  It was dost movies by watching  Bus stop title  Do you enjoyed that  Movie  Equally  To a movie which like suppose you are moving are you are watching the movie in your own language i am from hindi language from hindi language of english language i like to watch movie  Where i no need to read  The on screen text not subtitle  Obviously  Second ke  Because the first case when i am watching a movie with a different language  I need to see the what is going on in the video  I need to read the on screen text also  And sometimes narration is going on so i don t know whether it can be processed through email or not  It is always advisable that it should be animation plus narration so whenever you are there  You are providing some kind of simulation you are creating some kind of animation for the students  Try to avoid the onscreen text  Pure providing animation just have a background narration  This is the student to process information  Congress  Please one example i am providing you can find out so much of  So many things  Are integrated care  Figure 4 2000 graphic card  Ok there are different types of pictures are there  It s very difficult  To understand  So it is always advise  Avoid graphic word sound from the day  Brijbhan singh less is more  We can provide some information  Awesome concert by using les  Graphics words of sounds  Then that is the best  Don t use unnecessary  Think  Not relatable  Try to make it more simpler  As far as possible  About the queries  Multimedia principle multimedia  Ok here is the skull  Richard number  There is a skill  Which different parts  Where is the it is mentioned  Labelling is given  In which case it is easier  Second kiss  Because i can cool it ok this part is the frontal bone  Rishi kapoor hit boss whatsapp of this number i had given  And then later on i am saying ok this is the the number one  Is the frontal bone or whatever you cannot from biology  Later take one example  Ok so this like this one is the wall maar ok i can say that number 10 is world war  Very difficult for the student to  Recognise the different parts  Like this  Ok  Kabaddi we can provide here ok the student can correlate here  It will be easier  Pedestrian 2010 tak concert  Pictures plus words  Ok should be together  Next modality principle  Lord shiva mortality principal again this is very interesting so  Latest tech one example  Ok  In the first case you can see  Information  Like animation + narration  And animation and on screen  Again here the animation plus on screen text  That is  Single channel  But if there is animation  Animation  Last narration to channel starting you  So the information can be process easier  As compared to the first  Ok  It is always advisable for please provide animation with narration  As per as possible  Better than the onscreen text  Nexus the contributory principle  Locket equity principle here again you can see  They have provided  The labelling with different parts of share  What is the are doing today have  Number dear **** with alphabet and then here they are providing  The first win news fasi ok is front end of then he need to go for ok here is the frontal lobe  Ten hindi me to say ok what is eat then he took a game go down and then she ok this is the parietal lobe  But however in this case  What is happening the label for the parts of the brain are placed  Near the parts of the brain to which they are correspond  It is totally easy for restaurant the corresponding labels with the corresponding parts  In this chris case what is happening different parts  Interpreted from the image of the brain  Agale bling author  Levelling art separated from the different parts of the brain  Sudheer about the continuity paper  Very important is the signalling principle  People  Learn from the multimedia message when some kind of signals are  Aur  Suppose you are providing some information on the website or the user interface and in that  You think that some information are very very important  You need to highlight to provide the signal  For the student  You must be  Ready to understand this concept for this idea is very important you cannot avoid  Example whenever we have some website and then  Provide  Click here to download why  User interface design model why they are providing the signal to the user  Important part and you need to download  Until unless you your work will not happen  To make the user to make the system or the user interface easier  You should provide some important use of cygnus  Call dost  About the personalizing personalization principle  Kiya  Again it is not like you are just providing the animation or animation with narration that will be very  Good  Ok  It also important how  Are you providing the narration  Whether it s a conversation alve whether it s a formal way  It is always advisable  Whenever you are providing some kind of narration  It should be in the formal stand  I am gift giving example here so the narration is coming like that next i would like you to click on your name but in the other case  It s like click on the top name at the top of its like more former or mechanical in nature  Are humans and emo basically  They need interpersonal relationship  Aur  Feeling  Aur emotional  Ok  When you are providing this kind of conversation in wwe  Sofia rebel 2 mo  Correlate  Power cell with the system animation of simulation  It is always advisable whenever we are providing then a narration  It should be up should be in the conversation alve rather than the  Formal style  Very important thing is the pre training  Principal  I provide some citations also you can go to the citation and can get time formation of  Now  Features an example of body vr  About the author they have done  They have developed  Virtual reality  Aap august you man body or i think it s it s about the head of the cell  Wearing some kind of head mounted devices then you will feel like you have entered inside a cell and then  You can find out different parts of the same  What does pre training material is saying  So there thing that you know  You must be familiar  Vit a content item  Horse characteristics of the main concept  Before digging  I am providing you the journey of a cell  But  I have not provided you the information about different parts of animal cell  Then how you are going to recognise  When you will go to the journey inside the cell  You don t know mitochondria if you don t know cell membrane if you don t know who i was  If you don t know what is nucleus membrane  Cytoplasm  That will not  Show the purpose  Of the institute to take you  Having the experience  Apostille using virtual reality  I want research they have done  First have taught the students about different parts of animal cell  Ok  How it look like on baby  I m not saying that looks like at least they should know different parts different names  When they will have the vr experience of a cell if there is pop up  Cytoplasm of mitochondria can you can learn about the mitochondria or membrane or ribosome  And then that to serve the purpose  So  It is that  More deeply from a multimedia when they know the names and characteristics of the main concept  Next is about the segmenting principle  What is segmenting principle i think you can recall i have taught you about the  Information processing theory by  George  What miller set  Myle mention 7 plus minus 2  Idea  Right  Like either 549  Chance of information  Our brain can process at one time  Dosti mein le li  Suppose  I am teaching you the all the theory  Together in a single class  It will be difficult for you guys  Digestive information  To process information  But now what i have done i have segmented ok today  First i will discuss  Any idea about information processing  I will talk about that well coding theory  Then i will talk

in a  Shivam boys  In a conversation null time  Kuchh kam  Here you can see  We have discussed so many  Principles of auditing theory of multimedia learning  I am not saying that  We need to apply each and every principle  Whenever we are developing any product  Any app  Any user interface  Parineeti kinnaur contact teaching and learning content material  What we can try our best  Aspirate  I am giving you two examples here  You can see  This is before applying the cognitive theory of multimedia learning  Also before  And this is  So how they had used  So you can find out  Review of multimedia principles of what is the multimedia place of can you relate  Bullet text here the bullet text they have replaced by picture  It will be easier  Next the korean special all the pictures and
